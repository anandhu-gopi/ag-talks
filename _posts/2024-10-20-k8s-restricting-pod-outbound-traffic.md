Have you ever encountered a scenario where you need to control outbound traffic from your Kubernetes pod? Specifically, how can you ensure that your pod only communicates with the services necessary for its operation? Today, I will discuss one way to control outbound traffic in Kubernetes using egress rules and network policies.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ingress vs. Egress

Those who have worked in the K8s world are familiar with the term ingress. When you deploy an application in K8s and wish to expose it to the outside world, you typically create a deployment, service, and ingress.

While ingress manages incoming traffic, egress takes care of your outbound traffic. You can create network policies with egress rules to ensure that your application only communicates with the services necessary for its operation, thereby enhancing application security.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Egress, Network Policies, and Network Plugins

Just as we have ingress rules and ingress controllers implementing them, you can create network policies and include your egress rules there. Network plugins will take care of enforcing the egress rules (one such plugin is Calico). Please note that creating a NetworkPolicy resource without a controller that implements it will have no effect.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Targeted Egress Rules Using Pod Selectors üéØ

When creating network policies with egress rules, it's important to specify which deployments or pods the policy applies to. You can use a "podSelector" to target specific pods or leave it empty to apply the policy to all pods in the namespace.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Egress Rules: What Can Be Controlled?

You can apply the following restrictions to a pod via egress rules:

- **Pods** that your pod can communicate with.
- **Namespaces**: to access services running in a particular namespace.
- **IP blocks (CIDR ranges)** that your pod can connect to.

üö´ **When you create egress rules for your pod, it can only communicate with the specified pods, namespaces, or IP blocks in those rules; everything else is blocked.**

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Example

I have attached an example of an egress rule where a front-end application is restricted to communicate only with a back-end application and kube-dns (for resolving DNS names)
