This is the GitHub repo for my personal site — where I write blog posts, share notes.  
Built with Jekyll + Minimal Mistakes (because I like Markdown and knowing exactly what I’m maintaining).

Feel free to open issues/PRs if you spot typos, broken links, or have suggestions!

## Notes

To build locally:

* `bundle install --path vendor/bundle`
* `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Then visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the site.

## Deployment

The site is hosted with **GitHub Pages**.  
Pushing to the `main` branch will automatically build and update the live site.
